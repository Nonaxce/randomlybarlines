PS: **The viewport is not very optimized for mobile (u can't even push the generate buttonâœ¨ğŸ¥³)**

This âœ¨`<canvas>`âœ¨ based website randomly generates bar lines using a random array and displays
  it to the screen. Magenta lines exceed 750 while red lines are less than 50

Currently you can only generate the bar lines with the already random array generator,
  but soon I may add more user input and customizability.
Will add more stats soon other than average height.

Yeah tinkering around with `<canvas>` and javascript led me to this :P.
